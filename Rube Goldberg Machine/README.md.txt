Hi!

Unfortunately, I do not have an Ocuclus headset, so this version of the project is meant for (adn works properly with) the Vive! I took about 13 hours to finish this project! Something I liked was how this project mixed a variety of necessary skills for VR development. Some things I found challenging were the gameplay requirements, expecially when it came to working with lists in Unity, and keeping code organized as the project slowly grew in size.

****Update For Second Submission****
Thanks so much for your feedback. I have altered my project accordingly to fit all criteria! Thanks again!
