Hello!

I built this VR apartment project using Unity 5.6.1f1. I had to use the latest version of GVR due to issue in exporting/launching my build on my phone. I am using an Android device that is 6.0 (Marshmellow) capable. 

This project took me about 3-4 hours to complete. I liked the topics on lighting, since lighting on mobile is always a challenge. I foud some lectures on lighting confusing in how the lecture explained how not to use soft shadows, but we are using soft shadows in the project?

Best,
Tejas
